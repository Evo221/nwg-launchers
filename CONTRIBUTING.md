# Contributing to nwg-launchers

## Pull requests

This project has already been significantly improved by skilled programmers, and I do appreciate the fact. To keep things in the proper order, however, 
please consider the priority list:

1. bug fixes
2. new features
3. optimization, refactoring, e.t.c.

Please test your changes not in sway only, but also in i3 and Openbox.

Before submitting a major PR, it makes sense to open an issue, and discuss the changes you're planning on.

### Code formatting

Please use the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Formatting), especially if it comes to braces in Conditionals,
Loops and Switch statements. 80 characters in a line is all right, up to 120 is acceptable.

## Issues and Feature requests

...are the only feedback we have. Do not hesitate to submit.
